   There are a few presets included, but feel free to make your own!

   API:
   Weather:GetCurrentPrepset()
   Returns the current active weather preset
   
   Weather:GetCurrentPresetName()
   Returns the name of the current active weather preset

   Weather:SetPreset(presetName)
   Sets the weather preset of the given name, if available.

   Weather:SetFadedPreset(preset1, preset2, fadeAmount)

   There are other functions which are internally used by the Weather system. Feel free to explore them and experiment if you wish!
